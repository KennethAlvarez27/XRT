* [ ] Remove our copy of OpenCL Header files; directly use OpenCL header files available in /usr/include/CL.

* [ ] Upstream Emulation XRT to github.

* [ ] Upstream Sphinx documentation to github.

* [ ] Support *O=<dir>* option when compling xocl Linux kernel driver.

* [ ] Integrate Sphinx based documentation generation into cmake. Currently documentation generation happens in the source tree itself using its own Makefile.

* [ ] Build ERT with /tools/batonroot MB compiler if build is local within Xilinx.

* [ ] Make MB compiler public so that ERT can be built always.
